# The DMV at Ease: Making obtaining driver license information painless for all
## By Kristina Thabet for DH110
## Introduction
This project is about designing an application that makes it easy and intuitive for users to find information pertaining to the New York DMV Website. The application I created illustrates the process of navigating the New York DMV website to complete two different tasks: Finding information about changing your name on your drivers license and finding older driver resources. The New York DMV website is notoriously known for being saturated with so much information, making it difficult for users to obtain anwsers to specific questions they may have. Additionally, there are not a lot of DMV offices for larger urban areas, causing crowded and long lines which have only become worse due to COVID 19. Because of the New York DMV website's downfalls, I have worked to develop an application that is categorically organized and concise. This application can be navigated with ease for all users, minimizing the need to meet with a DMV representative in person or over the phone. This application not only tailors to users of all technology literacy levels, yet it allows users to search for specific keywords, making the search for information less time consuming.  

## Design Statement
Through my UX design project, I hope to ease the process of obtaining accurate DMV information online by making users of all computer literacy levels feel comfortable navigating my application. By creating a prototype that is interactive, clear to read, and enables search functions, I can hopefully motivate users to learn more about the DMV protocalls, creating a safer driving environment in New York.

## Competitor Analysis
To gain a better understanding of how other applications present information regarding maintaining driving records and supplying government program information , I conducted heuristic evaluations on two websites: the New York Drivers License Website and the New York Housing Services Website. I chose to conduct my evaluation on these websites because they both serve as good examples of government applications that are visited for practical reasons. Since users of a wide age range visit both of these websites, they should both be clear and intuitive to use for everyone-- a goal I was striving for in my own application as well. By using Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics to conduct this heuristic evaluation, I now have a greater understanding of how users interact with these websites and the role design plays in a well functioning website.

## User Research

I conducted usability testing on the New York Drivers License website in order to determine the extent to which a websites interface design impacts a users ability to complete tasks. The purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the website from the userâ€™s perspective. I learned that usability issues do exist for this website. For example, my participant thought that there was too much inconsistency in this website and she described the website as busy. This shows that the website does not reflect the aesthetic and minimalist design. It also took my participant longer than expected to find the recipe and print it out, showing there is a lack of visibility of system status. I learned to bear these issues in mind when designing my application to provide a better user experience for the users.
