# The DMV at Ease: Making obtaining driver license information painless for all
## By Kristina Thabet for DH110
## Introduction
This project is about designing an application that makes it easy and intuitive for users to find information pertaining to the New York DMV Website. The application I created illustrates the process of navigating the New York DMV website to complete two different tasks: Finding information about changing your name on your drivers license and finding older driver resources. The New York DMV website is notoriously known for being saturated with so much information, making it difficult for users to obtain anwsers to specific questions they may have. Additionally, there are not a lot of DMV offices for larger urban areas, causing crowded and long lines which have only become worse due to COVID 19. Because of the New York DMV website's downfalls, I have worked to develop an application that is categorically organized and concise. This application can be navigated with ease for all users, minimizing the need to meet with a DMV representative in person or over the phone. This application not only tailors to users of all technology literacy levels, yet it allows users to search for specific keywords, making the search for information less time consuming.  

## Design Statement
Through my UX design project, I hope to ease the process of obtaining accurate DMV information online by making users of all computer literacy levels feel comfortable navigating my application. By creating a prototype that is interactive, clear to read, and enables search functions, I can hopefully motivate users to learn more about the DMV protocalls, creating a safer driving environment in New York.

## Competitor Analysis
To gain a better understanding of how other applications present information regarding maintaining driving records and supplying government program information , I conducted heuristic evaluations on two websites: the New York Drivers License Website and the New York Housing Services Website. I chose to conduct my evaluation on these websites because they both serve as good examples of government applications that are visited for practical reasons. Since users of a wide age range visit both of these websites, they should both be clear and intuitive to use for everyone-- a goal I was striving for in my own application as well. By using Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics to conduct this heuristic evaluation, I now have a greater understanding of how users interact with these websites and the role design plays in a well functioning website.

## User Research

I conducted usability testing on the New York Drivers License website in order to determine the extent to which a websites interface design impacts a users ability to complete tasks. The purpose of this usability testing is to assess the website from a user's perspective and find ways to improve user experience. Throughout my research, I found that this website has usability issues ranging from unegaging colors to unorganized tabs. My user research participant also pointed out that many buttons on the page were not responsive when the cursor was placed over them, making the page seem slow and unresponsive. My participant also noted that there was an overwhelming amount of informastion on the page of the same type face, making it hard to distiguish which information is more important than others. Overall, conducting theis research revealed the importance of minimalist design and responsive buttons, motivating me to master these aspects in my own application.

## UX Storytelling
A key factor in developing an application that is beneficial to users involves creating personas and putting ourselves in the perspective of our users. By creating personas, journey maps, and empathy charts, we can reveal aspects of interface design that are most appropriate for our target audience. UX Storytelling allows designers to focus on the users' needs and the value you want to give those users. As we refine our design, we can think back to the personas we created to ensure that our application is intuitive for our target audience. I created two different personas that represent tasks that can be completed through this application. One persona portrays a teenager in need of a license while the other portrays a young adult who needs to change information on his license.
