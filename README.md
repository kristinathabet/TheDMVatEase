# The DMV at Ease: Making obtaining driver license information painless for all
## By Kristina Thabet for DH110
## Introduction
This project is about designing an application that makes it easy and intuitive for users to find information pertaining to the New York DMV Website. The application I created illustrates the process of navigating the New York DMV website to complete two different tasks: Finding information about changing your name on your drivers license and finding older driver resources. The New York DMV website is notoriously known for being saturated with so much information, making it difficult for users to obtain anwsers to specific questions they may have. Additionally, there are not a lot of DMV offices for larger urban areas, causing crowded and long lines which have only become worse due to COVID 19. Because of the New York DMV website's downfalls, I have worked to develop an application that is categorically organized and concise. This application can be navigated with ease for all users, minimizing the need to meet with a DMV representative in person or over the phone. This application not only tailors to users of all technology literacy levels, yet it allows users to search for specific keywords, making the search for information less time consuming.  

## Design Statement
Through my UX design project, I hope to ease the process of obtaining accurate DMV information online, making users of all computer literacy levels feel comfortable navigating my application. By offering  users feel impact the lives of senior citizens and others by offering an easy and seamless way to find recipes online that they would like to try and help them stay up-to-date to their favorite kinds of food by offering them to join various recipe communities to stay connected.
