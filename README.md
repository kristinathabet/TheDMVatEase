# The DMV at Ease: Making obtaining driver license information painless for all
## By Kristina Thabet for DH110
## Introduction
This project is about designing an application that makes it easy and intuitive for users to find information pertaining to the New York DMV Website. The application I created illustrates the process of navigating the New York DMV website to complete two different tasks: Finding information about changing your name on your drivers license and finding older driver resources. The New York DMV website is notoriously known for being saturated with so much information, making it difficult for users to obtain anwsers to specific questions they may have. Additionally, there are not a lot of DMV offices for larger urban areas, causing crowded and long lines which have only become worse due to COVID 19. Because of the New York DMV website's downfalls, I have worked to develop an application that is categorically organized and concise. This application can be navigated with ease for all users, minimizing the need to meet with a DMV representative in person or over the phone. This application not only tailors to users of all technology literacy levels, yet it allows users to search for specific keywords, making the search for information less time consuming.  

## Design Statement
Through my UX design project, I hope to ease the process of obtaining accurate DMV information online by making users of all computer literacy levels feel comfortable navigating my application. By creating a prototype that is interactive, clear to read, and enables search functions, I can hopefully motivate users to learn more about the DMV protocalls, creating a safer driving environment in New York.

## Competitor Analysis
To gain a better understanding of how other applications present information regarding maintaining driving records and supplying government program information , I conducted heuristic evaluations on two websites: the New York Drivers License Website and the New York Housing Services Website. I chose to conduct my evaluation on these websites because they both serve as good examples of government applications that are visited for practical reasons. Since users of a wide age range visit both of these websites, they should both be clear and intuitive to use for everyone-- a goal I was striving for in my own application as well. By using Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics to conduct this heuristic evaluation, I now have a greater understanding of how users interact with these websites and the role design plays in a well functioning website.

## User Research

I conducted usability testing on the New York Drivers License website in order to determine the extent to which a websites interface design impacts a users ability to complete tasks. The purpose of this usability testing is to assess the website from a user's perspective and find ways to improve user experience. Throughout my research, I found that this website has usability issues ranging from unegaging colors to unorganized tabs. My user research participant also pointed out that many buttons on the page were not responsive when the cursor was placed over them, making the page seem slow and unresponsive. My participant also noted that there was an overwhelming amount of informastion on the page of the same type face, making it hard to distiguish which information is more important than others. Overall, conducting theis research revealed the importance of minimalist design and responsive buttons, motivating me to master these aspects in my own application.

## UX Storytelling
A key factor in developing an application that is beneficial to users involves creating personas and putting ourselves in the perspective of our users. By creating personas, journey maps, and empathy charts, we can reveal aspects of interface design that are most appropriate for our target audience. UX Storytelling allows designers to focus on the users' needs and the value you want to give those users. As we refine our design, we can think back to the personas we created to ensure that our application is intuitive for our target audience. I created two different personas that represent tasks that can be completed through this application. One persona portrays a teenager in need of a license while the other portrays a young adult who needs to change information on his license. Below are the two personas I created.

## Low- Fidelity Prototype 
I created this low- fidelity prototype to test the functionality of the design with users and make further adjustments to the design before working on the high-fidelity prototypes. Aligning with my user personas needs, I created a low-fidelity prototype of three different tasks: Finding steps to obtain a New York license, changing the name on a license, and finding information about medical conditions that hinder legal and safe driving. Through these prototypes, I was able to expose dead ends and confusion in the application during the early stages of the design process. I tested the low-fidelity prototype with a user that fits the target audience in order to gain some perspective of how intuitive the wireflow is as well as how well the frames flow together.

## High- Fidelity Prototype
After creating and testing my low- fidelity prototype, I created a high-fidelity prototype of two previously stated tasks: finding information about changing a name on a license and obtaining older driver resources. I created this prototype on Figma, using the autoflow plugin to wireflow between the frames. I then tested this high-fidelity prototype to examine the functionality of the two tasks at hand. High-fidelity prototypes also allow designers to fully visualize design elements and assess if the look and feel of the application is consistent with the tasks that can be completed. This is where all graphic design elements and UI material components are fully visulaized. I tested many different design variations including color, type font, button shape, and spacing in order to find what I felt works best. I decided on a dark and sleek design with simple typeface that is clear and easy to read. My design passes the color check for all color variations and is consistent between all frames.
